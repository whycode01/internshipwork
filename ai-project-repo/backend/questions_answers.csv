Question,Answer
What is the primary responsibility of the architect in a project?,"The primary responsibility of the architect is to define the overall structure, design principles, and technology stack for the project while ensuring alignment with business goals and technical requirements."
How do you measure the success of an architectural design?,"Success is measured by performance metrics, scalability, maintainability, security, and alignment with project goals."
What are the key considerations for selecting trade-offs between different architectural components?,"Trade-offs should consider performance, scalability, cost, complexity, and alignment with business priorities."
How does the architecture support scalability requirements?,"By implementing load balancing, horizontal scaling, caching strategies, and designing stateless components."
What are the performance considerations that should be incorporated into the architectural design?,"Considerations include efficient resource allocation, minimizing latency, reducing bottlenecks, and optimizing database queries."
How do you ensure that the architecture supports maintainability requirements?,"By adhering to modular design principles, writing clean code, and ensuring clear documentation."
What methods can be used to evaluate the fit-for-purpose of an architectural solution?,"Methods include proof-of-concept development, benchmarking, and load testing."
How is it possible for the architecture to meet multiple business goals simultaneously?,By designing flexible and modular solutions that accommodate varying business priorities.
What are the key steps involved in ensuring architectural compliance across the implementation lifecycle?,"Steps include establishing coding standards, conducting design reviews, and implementing automated testing."
How does the architecture support disaster recovery requirements?,"By implementing backup solutions, failover strategies, and ensuring data replication."
What approaches can be used to balance innovation with stability in the design?,"Balancing can be achieved through controlled experimentation, phased rollouts, and robust fallback mechanisms."
How do you ensure that the architecture supports security throughout the development lifecycle?,"By implementing secure coding practices, regular security audits, and penetration testing."
What techniques can be employed to maintain data integrity during implementation?,"Techniques include data validation, transaction management, and consistent error handling."
How are assumptions about the future behavior of systems documented and validated?,Assumptions are documented in design artifacts and validated through prototyping and stakeholder review.
What methods are used to achieve internationalization and localization for an architectural solution?,"Methods include string externalization, Unicode support, and region-specific content delivery."
How does the architecture support clear and understandable design decisions?,"By maintaining clear documentation, visual diagrams, and decision logs."
What approaches are used to define boundaries around system or component design?,"By leveraging domain-driven design principles, defining clear API contracts, and identifying key data flows."
How do you ensure that the architecture addresses user experience requirements?,"By integrating user feedback, conducting usability testing, and applying UI/UX design principles."
What measures can be taken to ensure cost-effectiveness in the architecture selection process?,"By evaluating cloud costs, using open-source technologies, and adopting serverless or container-based solutions."
"How is architectural complexity measured, and what factors should be considered?","Complexity is measured by evaluating the number of components, integration points, and dependency chains within the system."
