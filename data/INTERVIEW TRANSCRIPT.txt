Priya Sharma: Good morning, Mr. Ambani. Thank you for joining us today.

Mukesh Ambani: Good morning, Priya. It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me.

Priya Sharma: Let’s begin by understanding what drew you to this role, given your extensive legacy at Reliance.

Mukesh Ambani: Certainly. While my tenure at Reliance has been transformative both for the company and for me personally, I believe the future lies in global innovation, sustainability, and digital transformation at scale. I’m drawn to this opportunity because I see a unique potential to apply my experience in building ecosystems—across energy, telecom, and retail—to a broader global context. I'm not looking for a title—I’m looking to make impact.

Arjun Mehta: Your work with Jio revolutionized India’s digital infrastructure. How would you replicate or scale that strategy globally?

Mukesh Ambani: Jio succeeded by democratizing data access. The formula was affordability, accessibility, and future-focused investments. To scale globally, we must align with local needs—investing in indigenous technologies, open platforms, and fostering public-private partnerships. The key is to create shared value while ensuring digital inclusion across economic tiers.

Sarah Williams: What’s your leadership style when dealing with massive, cross-functional teams in high-stakes environments?

Mukesh Ambani: I believe in visionary delegation. Set a clear goal—almost audacious—and empower teams to innovate their way toward it. I keep communication lines open but trust the execution to strong leaders. My job is to ensure alignment, culture, and capital—three Cs. Also, I do not micromanage, but I am extremely detail-conscious.

Priya Sharma: How do you handle failure?

Mukesh Ambani: Failure is inevitable in business, especially when you innovate. I see it as tuition fees paid for future success. One of the key lessons I’ve learned is to fail fast, pivot faster, and never let ego cloud judgment. I cultivate a culture where admitting a misstep is not punished—it’s analyzed, documented, and learned from.

Arjun Mehta: Where do you stand on AI and its future in enterprise?

Mukesh Ambani: AI is no longer a tech vertical; it’s horizontal. It will impact every industry, from logistics and health to law and agriculture. But AI must be rooted in ethics and inclusivity. We need to ensure that innovation doesn’t outpace governance. I envision AI as a co-pilot—not a master—for human-led innovation.

Sarah Williams: If selected, what’s the first initiative you’d like to launch in the first 100 days?

Mukesh Ambani: I would launch a cross-continental innovation fellowship program that taps into young minds from underrepresented regions. At the same time, I’d initiate an internal audit of all ESG practices across the group to align with 2030 sustainability goals. The goal is: inspire innovation from within while ensuring we are accountable globally.

Priya Sharma: One final question—how do you stay grounded?

Mukesh Ambani: I credit that to my family, my spiritual grounding, and the constant reminder that wealth and power are means—not ends. At heart, I remain a student—curious, evolving, and driven by purpose.

Priya Sharma: Thank you, Mr. Ambani. It’s been an insightful conversation.

Mukesh Ambani: Thank you. I appreciate your time and the thoughtful questions.
